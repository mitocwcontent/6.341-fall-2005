The project assignments in this section refer to Athena, which is MIT's UNIX®-based computing environment.

Two projects were assigned over the course of the term. Students were asked to submit written project reports and any appropriate MATLAB® plots. The instructions for both projects are included in a single file. (![This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.](/images/inacessible.gif)[PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/projectf05))
